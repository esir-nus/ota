# OTA Testing and Deployment Task List (MVP)

This document tracks the essential tasks for testing and deployment of the OTA daemon, following the MVP approach.

## MVP Testing Principles
- Focus on critical functionality verification
- Test essential features thoroughly
- Validate user workflows end-to-end
- Prioritize stability and security
- Document issues for future resolution

## GitHub Repository Setup
- [x] Create new repository named "ota"
- [x] Initialize with README.md and .gitignore
- [x] Push existing codebase to repository

## Ubuntu VM Testing Environment (Single VM Approach)
- [x] Create Ubuntu 20.04 VM with:
  - [x] 2 CPU cores, 2 GB RAM, 10 GB storage
  - [x] Network access to test update server
- [x] Install essential dependencies:
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip python3-dev python3-venv git
  ```
- [x] Set up basic directory structure:
  ```bash
  sudo mkdir -p /opt/robot-ai
  sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/ota/{backups,downloads,cache,db}
  sudo mkdir -p /etc/ota
  sudo mkdir -p /var/log/ota
  ```
- [x] Install OTA daemon using installation guide
- [x] Install required Python dependencies:
  ```bash
  source ~/venv/bin/activate
  pip install pyyaml structlog
  ```

## Core Integration Tests (MVP Priority)
Following procedures in `docs/integration_testing.md`, focusing on critical tests:

### Critical Path Tests (High Priority)
- [x] BF-01: Start OTA daemon service
- [ ] BF-03: Access API status endpoint
- [ ] UD-02: Check with test manifest (newer version)
- [ ] UI-01: Download and install test update
- [ ] BR-01: Create system backup
- [ ] BR-04: Test automatic rollback
- [ ] MP-01: Configure for alternate product type

### Essential API Tests
- [ ] API-01: Test API endpoints with valid credentials
- [ ] API-03: Test WebSocket connections

## GUI Tool Essential Validation

### Update Generator Core Testing
- [ ] Test with robot-ai-standard product type
- [ ] Validate manifest generation
- [ ] Verify package creation

### Daemon Manager Core Testing
- [ ] Test connectivity with valid credentials
- [ ] Test update check functionality
- [ ] Test update installation functionality

## Production Readiness (MVP)
- [ ] Address critical issues found during testing
- [ ] Update installation guide based on testing experience
- [ ] Verify security of API key implementation
- [ ] Perform clean installation validation

## Documentation Updates
- [ ] Document test results for critical path tests
- [ ] Update README with current status and limitations

## Future Testing (Post-MVP)
The following tests are important but can be prioritized for post-MVP releases:

- Additional platform testing (Ubuntu 22.04)
- Edge case testing (insufficient disk space, network interruptions)
- Additional product type testing
- Resource utilization analysis
- Extended security review

## Test Results Log
Use this section to document test results as they are completed:

```
Test ID: BF-01
Date: 2023-05-21
Tester: Robot
Result: PASS
Issues: Initially had issues with service file location. Fixed by copying ota.service to /etc/systemd/system/
```

```
Test ID: Dependency Issue - PyYAML
Date: 2023-05-21
Tester: Robot
Result: FIXED
Issues: OTA daemon service failed with 'ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'yaml''. Fixed by installing PyYAML with 'pip install pyyaml' in the virtual environment.
```

```
Test ID: Dependency Issue - structlog
Date: 2023-05-21
Tester: Robot
Result: IN PROGRESS
Issues: After fixing PyYAML dependency, service failed with 'ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'structlog''. Installing structlog with 'pip install structlog' in the virtual environment.
```

```
Test ID: BF-03
Date: 2023-05-21
Tester: Robot
Result: IN PROGRESS
Issues: API endpoint 'http://localhost:5000/api/v1/status' not responding. API service might not be properly starting despite the service showing as active.
```
